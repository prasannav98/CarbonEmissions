# Data Processing and Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes carbon emissions and temperature trends using datasets from `carbon_emission.csv` and `temperature.csv`. The analysis involves data processing, statistical calculations, and visualizations to explore relationships between carbon emissions and temperature variations.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `plotly.graph_objects` and `plotly.express` for data visualization

## Workflow
1. **Loading Data**
   - Reads `carbon_emission.csv` and `temperature.csv` using Pandas.
   - Displays the first few rows and checks the number of records in each dataset.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Extracts temperature values from year-based columns and reshapes them.
   - Computes key statistical measures (mean, median, variance) for temperature and COâ‚‚ concentration values.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Uses Plotly to create interactive plots visualizing trends in carbon emissions and temperature changes.

## How to Use
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install pandas plotly`).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to process the datasets and generate visualizations.
3. Analyze the computed statistics and graphical representations to identify patterns.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional climate variables for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Enhance visualizations with interactive filters and annotations.
- Implement machine learning models to predict future trends.
